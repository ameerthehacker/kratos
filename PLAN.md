# Kratos plan

Status legend: `[ ]` todo · `[~]` in progress · `[x]` done (with proof noted)

Goal of milestone 1: **Kratos can host its own development** — a session started from the Kratos
UI, running Claude Code, enforcing plan → scoped step → proof → walkthrough → gate.

## Milestone 1 — self-hosting

- [x] **0. Scaffold** — turborepo, `kratos` CLI serving the web app, WebSocket hello/ping,
      draft core types, v0 guardrail hooks. Scope: everything.
- [x] **0b. Library-first pass** — replace hand-rolled code from step 0 with standard libraries
      (Fastify, zod, commander, react-use-websocket; hooks: picomatch, simple-git, shell-quote).
      Scope: `apps/**`, `packages/core/**`, `.claude/**`, root config. Accept: build + typecheck
      pass, server and hook checks re-run with the same results as step 0.
- [x] **1. Agent interface review** — owner reviews and finalizes the draft `AgentAdapter` /
      `AgentEvent` types in `packages/core/src/agent.ts`. Scope: `packages/core/**`.
      Accept: owner can explain each type; decisions logged.
- [x] **2. Claude Code adapter** — spawn the `claude` CLI in its RPC mode (`-p` with stream-json
      in/out and `--permission-prompt-tool=stdio`), speak its JSON-lines + control protocol
      directly (no SDK), map its messages to `AgentEvent`s. New package
      `packages/adapter-claude-code`. Split per D24: this step = `protocol.ts` + `index.ts`.
      Accept: a throwaway script sends prompts and prints normalized events (deny, allow,
      multi-turn, interrupt).
- [x] **2c. Demo script** — `pnpm --filter @kratos/adapter-claude-code demo --cwd <dir> "<prompt>"`; owner
      answers permission prompts in the terminal. Scope: `src/demo.ts` (already drafted).
- [x] **2b. Budget system v2** (D24) — budgets measure review load (insertions, in-scope files,
      config/lockfiles/docs excluded); steps declare an `estimate` up front; warn at 80%; over
      budget → owner chooses extend / checkpoint / split. Scope: `.claude/**`.
      Accept: hook test cases pass; CLAUDE.md rule 3 rewritten.
- [ ] **3. Session over WebSocket** — UI sends a prompt, server runs the adapter, streams events
      back; UI renders a raw event log. Accept: live demo in the browser.
- [ ] **4. Plan artifact** — plan file model + UI to view/edit steps; agent must write a plan
      before code.
- [ ] **5. Step gates** — scope fence + budget enforced by Kratos itself (via
      `requestPermission`), using the D24 model: steps carry an estimate (agent must split before
      coding if it exceeds the budget); budget = review load (in-scope insertions, config/lockfiles/
      docs/excluded globs free); live budget meter in the UI; warn the agent at 80%; over budget →
      UI gate with **Extend** (+N lines, reason logged) / **Checkpoint** (commit what works, continue
      as a new step) / **Split** / **Revert**. Approve/reject between steps; checkpoints via git.
- [ ] **6. Decision ledger** — decisions captured as structured events, shown in UI, flippable.
- [ ] **7. Dogfood** — build step 8+ of Kratos using Kratos.

## Later ideas (not committed)

- Autonomy dial per path / action type
- "Predict" mode and "you write this" mode in the UI
- Data-flow walkthrough view per step
- Rewind / branch from any checkpoint
- More adapters (Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, Aider…)
- Track estimate vs actual per step to calibrate future estimates (step 2 missed by ~30%)
